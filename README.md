# Pre-requisite
- üê≥Docker (any version): [Download here](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/)
- ‚öôÔ∏èCurvelet 2.1.3: [Download here](http://curvelet.org/)
- ‚öôÔ∏èFFTW 2.1.5: [Download here](https://www.fftw.org/download.html) 
- Tested on Windows

‚ö†Ô∏è You may need to alter the Dockerfile if you use different version than these

‚ö†Ô∏è Don't change the filename! Unless you understand which parts of the code that need to be adjusted
  - CurveLab filename: `CurveLab-2.1.3.tar.gz`
  - FFTW filename: `fftw-2.1.5.tar.gz`

‚ö†Ô∏è Soon be published on Docker hub

# How to install?
1) Run Docker on your machine
2) Clone the repo
3) Download the Curvelet and FFTW, put the `tar.gz` in the same folder
4) Rebuild the image

‚ö†Ô∏è make sure you're in the same folder!
~~~
docker build -t <Your Docker Username>/py-cs-cvt:1.0 .
~~~

OR if u are on Windows platform, can simply execute
~~~
build.bat
~~~
4) Check the tag name, look after the specified tag.
~~~
docker images
~~~

# How to run?

Execute this on your Windows cmd

~~~
docker run -it -p 8888:8888 <the container tag>
~~~~

Since the image was wrapped as Jupyter notebook, you can copy-paste the link to a browser.

# What's inside the py_cs_cvt?
- find the wrapped CS-CVT at the bottom of the Jupyter notebook
- For the example, just run the whole notebook at once
